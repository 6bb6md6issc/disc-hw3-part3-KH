Hey there! Welcome to the course site for Develop & Innovate for Social Change's fall 2024 workshop series! In this quarter-long series, we will walk you through the fundamentals of modern web development and how to build web applications from end-to-end. If you are new to Northwestern, welcome! We are excited to see you here and to be a part of our community.

If you new to DISC, here is some background information about us as an organization:

[DISC](https://sites.northwestern.edu/discnu/) was founded in 2017 and our primary goal is to expand Northwestern students' perceptions of the capabilities of technology. Recognizing the power of collaboration across difference, we look for the right balance of technical and non-technical skills to assemble project teams of diverse and hardworking student leaders interested in using technology to make a positive impact on the world. We challenge our members to grow as they work for community clients in Evanston and Chicago. As of Fall 2024, DISC currently has about 300 total members with members having interned or working full-time at companies such as Salesforce, Group One Trading, Splunk, Citadel, and many other big tech and various quant/trading firms.

Here is our leadership team for the 2024-2025 School Year:

## Why should I care about the workshop series?

The Fall Workshop Series is your unique opportunity to get hands-on and _real_ experience building a full-stack application at Northwestern end-to-end. While there are certainly classes that can do the same for you, this is why DISC is unique:

1. **Industry-Relevant Skills**: Our workshops are designed to teach you the most up-to-date and in-demand technologies used in the tech industry today. From modern front-end frameworks like React to back-end technologies like Node.js and Express, you'll be learning tools that are actively used in professional software development.

2. **Project-Based Learning**: Unlike traditional classes, our workshop series is centered around building a real, functional web application from start to finish. This project-based approach allows you to immediately apply what you learn, reinforcing your understanding and giving you a tangible product to showcase in your portfolio.

3. **Collaborative Environment**: DISC workshops provide a unique opportunity to work alongside peers who share your passion for technology and social impact. This collaborative setting mimics real-world development teams, helping you develop crucial teamwork and communication skills.

4. **Mentorship from Experienced Students**: Our workshops are led by upperclassmen who have internship experience at top tech companies. Both Amy & Ethan have been working in the web development sphere of Software Engineering for multiple years. Both of them have interned as professional web developers and bring their own unique opinions, experiences, and knowledge to you so you can begin your web development journey.

5. **Preparation for Internships and Careers**: The skills you'll gain from this workshop series will directly prepare you for technical interviews and internships. Many DISC members have leveraged their experience to secure positions at leading tech companies and startups.

6. **Social Impact Focus**: Unlike purely technical courses, DISC emphasizes using technology for social good. You'll learn how to apply your skills to create meaningful change, which can be a powerful differentiator in your future career.

7. **Networking Opportunities**: Through DISC, you'll connect with a diverse community of tech-minded students, alumni, and industry professionals. These connections can be invaluable for your future career prospects.

8. **Flexibility and Support**: Our workshop series is designed to accommodate students with varying levels of technical background. Whether you're a complete beginner or have some coding experience, you'll find the support and resources you need to succeed.

By participating in this workshop series, you're not just learning to code â€“ you're joining a community, building a professional network, and positioning yourself for success in the tech industry while making a positive impact on society.
