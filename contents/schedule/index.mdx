### Project Deadlines

Assignments will be released week-by-week during the workshop that they correspond with. For example, Assignment one will be released during Workshop one, Assignment 2 during Workshop 2, etc. etc.

**These are some guidelines to go for every project**:

1. If you wish to be considered for the DISCover program application, you **must** submit this project as part of your application. This means that ideally, your project **needs** to be finished by the time that DISCover applications are due. The current deadline is still in the works, but you can expect that it will be due sometime in the start of Wniter Quarter 2025

_Submitting all assignments demostrates commitment, which one of the most important facotrs in the DISCover application_

_Submitting good work demostrates technical competence, which is the second most important factor in the DISCover program application_

2. If you want feedback on your current progress, progress, or if you have any questions, comments, or concerns, you can reach out to either of the technical leads: [Ethan Pineda](mailto:EthanPineda2025@u.northwestern.edu) or [Amy Liao](mailto:AmyLiao2025@u.northwestern.edu)

_If you want feedback on a submission or project, you must do so within one week of it being assigned. Essentially, the project must be turned in before the start of the next workshop_

_**It is strongly recommended that you turn in your assignment by the one-week deadline**. This is because (1) you don't have to cram later and can enjoy your winter break and (2) you can improve your final submission for the DISCover program application based on feedback from DISC exec/the technical leads._
