title: Assignment I: Figma Wireframe
description: In workshop I, we covered the basics of what the web and the various things that as developers we should be aware of such as accessibility and responsiveness. In assignment I, you will create a wireframe of your web app using Figma.
---

## Guidelines

_Your wireframe *must* include the following:_

- At least 3 different pages (exampels: home page, about page, create profile page, edit profile page, user search page etc).
- A navigation bar on every page
- A footer bar on every page
- A display of many profiles on the same page (lis view, grid view, and other alternative are all aceptable).
- Explanations of what buttons do and what other interactions users can have with your app
- _At least_ 4 colors (yes black & white count). The color palette you choose **must be accessbile** (see lecture material for reference)

_The following guidelines are optional and you can think of them as being 'extra credit'_

- Make your Figma design look nice and professional
- Wireframe more than three pages
- Simulate functionality of the site using Figma prototype settings
- Make your Figma responsive

## Tips

- The better quality your Figma wireframe, the easier it will be to actually code the interface later
- Keep the interface as simple as possible. Don't overcomplicate the UI and make it harder for your future self to implement the site
- Keep in mind the feature requirements of the project (see project introduction tab)
- Look at some existing social networking / social media apps for inspiration
