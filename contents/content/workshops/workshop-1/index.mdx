title: Workshop I - Introduction to DISC & UI/UX
---

Welcome to the first workshop! This workshop will cover the basics of UI/UX Design and teach you how to create high-fidelity user interfaces using Figma.

## Workshop Topics
- **What is UI/UX?**  
  UI/UX encompasses not just web design, but the design of everyday objects and experiences. We explored real-world examples like the impact of small changes on user experience and business outcomes.

- **The Importance of UI/UX**  
  Effective UI/UX design can enhance a business's professional image, improve user experience, and support inclusivity. We emphasized the significance of accessibility, from high-contrast color choices to accessible fonts and responsive layouts.

- **Designing for Responsiveness**  
  Adapting designs for various devices—mobile, tablet, desktop, and beyond—is crucial. We discussed mobile-first development and looked at examples of responsive design in action.

- **Wireframing**  
  We introduced different levels of fidelity in wireframing, from pen-and-paper sketches to digital tools like Figma. Participants practiced creating a simple website wireframe to prepare for the Figma demo.

- **Introduction to Figma**  
  We covered the basics of Figma, including its features for organization, accessibility tools, and responsive design. Attendees learned how to set up a project in Figma and explored essential elements such as auto layout, design systems, and collaborative tools.
  The demo walked through building a simple, high-contrast website with multiple pages, a navigation bar, a contact form, and an image grid. Participants are encouraged to recreate their wireframe in Figma as homework.
