description: A quick overview of the DISC student org.

[DISC](https://sites.northwestern.edu/discnu/) was founded in 2017 and our primary goal is to expand Northwestern students' perceptions of the capabilities of technology. Recognizing the power of collaboration across difference, we look for the right balance of technical and non-technical skills to assemble project teams of diverse and hardworking student leaders interested in using technology to make a positive impact on the world. We challenge our members to grow as they work for community clients in Evanston and Chicago. As of Fall 2024, DISC currently has about 300 total members with members having interned or working full-time at companies such as Salesforce, Group One Trading, Splunk, Citadel, and many other big tech and various quant/trading firms.

Here is our leadership team for the 2024-2025 School Year:
